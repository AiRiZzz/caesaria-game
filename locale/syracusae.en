  "##syracusae_4_overview##" : "Syracusae is an important site for a new colony. A glance at the map will show you why. If we are to expand the Empire much beuonf the shores of Italia, we must control these waters.\n Others have reached the same conclusion. We have been unable to reliably estabilish a permanent city of any size of Syaracusae. The challenge it is! - is to found a new city, and defend it againg the enemies of Rome. Expect trouble from the Graeci.\n To make matters more -- interesting, shall we say?... Syracusae has precious little farmland. Althrough the climate is ideal for olives, you will probably have to commit much of your farming to wheat, hust to feel your people. Perhaps you can alleviate food storage with imports, I don't know. I have not studied all the small details of assignment; that is why I hire governors. I do hope  that you can grow at least some olives. The Empire has a voracious appetite for oil. \n Knowing the difficulties in this assignment, i have set only modest goals for you to achieve. I trust you overcome the obstacles and succeed at least as well as you did last time."
